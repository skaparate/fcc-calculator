# FCC Calculator

This project was developed for the [free code camp's front end libraries projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) by [Nicolas Mancilla Vergara (skaparate)](https://nicomv.com/).

The calculator works by either clicking the buttons or using the keyboard, however, I didn't take into account other layous than a spanish keyboards and, using firefox, when You press the division key (*/*) it opens the quick search instead of adding the division operator.

A working project can be found [clicking here](https://angular-calculator.nicomv.com/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.10.
